Project Description:

An application that allows users to find recipes based on diets, allergies, and cuisine type that also provides nutritional information.

User Story:

AS A person who likes to cook
I WANT to easily find recipes according to my specifications
SO THAT I can have multiple options without having to filter them manually

APIs to be used:

Recipe Search API by Edamam: https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-docs-recipe-api
Nutrition Analysis by Edamam: https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-docs-nutrition-api

Additional notes/brainstorming:

Include search bar near top of webpage so user can search by keyword, have sections for cuisine (i.e. Italian, Indian, Chinese etc.),
for diet restrictions and allergies. Each type within each section could be a button. Include pictures or icons in addition to text
titles/labels on the buttons to make it more user friendly and eye-catching (think uber eats interface). Could have option to bookmark
or make lists of recipes for easy access when revisiting the page (use local storage). -SG
